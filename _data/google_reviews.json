In my GCSE’s he managed to help me get my grade to a very high level 9 and hasn’t only exponentially boosted my level in maths but has also helped me apply said knowledge into my own life. He not only provides incredible tutoring but is a very kind and considerate man who i am so lucky to have in my life and am looking forwards to the next 2 years of him helping me with both my maths and further maths a-levels.",
