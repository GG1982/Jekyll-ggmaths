He's great at explaining concepts in a way that makes sense and even adds a touch of humour to keep things light. He's genuinely passionate about what he does, and it shows in how our kids have grown to appreciate math.",

In my GCSE’s he managed to help me get my grade to a very high level 9 and hasn’t only exponentially boosted my level in maths but has also helped me apply said knowledge into my own life. He not only provides incredible tutoring but is a very kind and considerate man who i am so lucky to have in my life and am looking forwards to the next 2 years of him helping me with both my maths and further maths a-levels.",
