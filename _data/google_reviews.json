                "text": "Giuliano helped me to achieve a grade A in maths A-Levels and I honestly could not have done it without his incredible support. He is super friendly and approachable. I always felt very comfortable to ask him to go over a question or topic that I didn't understand. He always explained key concepts very well, that had not been taught in school yet. This allowed me to get ahead and spend more time practicing exam questions rather than learning theory. As well as that he pushed me to become familiar with challenging questions so that questions in the actual exam did not seem daunting. Giuliano was always readily available. There was multiple times where I reached out to him via messaging to help me with a question I was stuck on even with the mark scheme. He also gave me lots of insight and tips and helped keep me calm and confident during the exams. I cannot recommend him enough, Thank you for everything Giuliano! üòÑ",

In my GCSE‚Äôs he managed to help me get my grade to a very high level 9 and hasn‚Äôt only exponentially boosted my level in maths but has also helped me apply said knowledge into my own life.
