<p>Many people believe you have to be born good at maths. This is not true. While some find it easier, anyone can improve with practice.</p>

<h2>Exams Are Designed for Everyone</h2>
<p>Maths exams are not made for geniuses. They follow a structure, and anyone who puts in the work can succeed.</p>
<p>The key is <strong>repetition</strong>. You don't need talent - you need <strong>consistent effort</strong>.</p>

<h2>Small Improvements Add Up</h2>
<p>Many students think they will never be good at maths. But they don't realise how much they can improve by making small steps every day.</p>
<p>Even 20 minutes of practice daily adds up to <strong>over 120 hours in a year</strong>. That is enough to go from struggling to confident.</p>

<h2>Success Comes from Consistency</h2>
<p>All of my <strong>Grade 9 students at GCSE</strong> get the highest grade possible. Why? Because for at least six months, they complete the equivalent of <strong>one exam paper every week</strong>.</p>
<p>My <strong>highest ever A* student</strong> scored an average of <strong>96%</strong> across all three exams. He had lessons <strong>twice a week</strong> and completed <strong>30-40 questions per week for two years</strong> - including summer.</p>

<h2>Build Long-Term Memory</h2>
<p>Just understanding a topic once is not enough. You need to <strong>repeat it over time</strong> so it sticks in your long-term memory.</p>
<p>The best way is to redo the same types of questions until they feel easy. This is how top students succeed - they don't stop when they “get it.”</p>
<p>They <strong>keep practising until they can't get it wrong</strong>.</p>

<h2>Challenge the "I'm Just Bad at Maths" Mindset</h2>
<p>If you believe you are bad at maths, you won't try. But the truth is, maths is a skill like any other.</p>
<p>No one expects to play the piano without practice. No one expects to get fit without exercise. <strong>Maths is the same</strong> - if you put in the effort, you will improve.</p>
