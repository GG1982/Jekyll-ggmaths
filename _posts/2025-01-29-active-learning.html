<p>Watching YouTube videos won't make you good at maths. Just like watching someone play tennis won't make you win Wimbledon.</p>

<p>Many students believe that watching lessons is enough. It's not. You need to actively engage with the material to improve.</p>

<h2>Common Excuses & Why They Don't Work</h2>
<p>Many students say things like:</p>
<blockquote>
    "I understand it when I watch the video, so I don't need to practise. I'll do questions later, I just need to watch more first."
</blockquote>
<p>These excuses may feel valid, but they hold you back. </p>
<p>Understanding while watching is not the same as being able to solve problems on your own.</p> 
<p>Without practice, the knowledge fades quickly, and you struggle when faced with new variations of the same topic.</p>
<p>Maths is a skill, and like any skill, improvement only comes with active practice.</p>

<p>Even if you get stuck, the struggle helps your brain learn.</p>

<h2>The Active Learning Approach</h2>

<p>Here's what you should do instead:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Watch a video or read a solution, then cover it up and try it yourself.</li>
    <li>For every example you see, attempt a similar one on your own.</li>
    <li>Check your answers and learn from mistakes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>To truly learn maths, you need to test yourself</h2>

<p>Retrieval practice is a great way to do this - cover your notes and try to recall key steps from memory.</p> 
<p>If you struggle, that's a sign you need more practice. 
<p>Another powerful method is explaining to a friend (or even an imaginary student).</p> 
<p>Teaching forces you to organise your thoughts and spot gaps in your understanding.</p>
<p>Finally, try timed drills - set a timer and push yourself to answer questions quickly.</p> 
<p>This builds confidence and prepares you for real exam conditions.</p>
<p>Doing is learning. The more you practise, the better you'll get.</p>
