<p>Maths is like a chain. Each topic builds on the one before it. You learn addition and subtraction first. Then you use them to understand multiplication and division.</p>
<p>Later, you apply those skills to fractions, ratios, and more.</p>

<p>Maybe you are someone who struggles a lot with one of these topics.</p>

<h2>Why This Happens</h2>
<p>It's not your fault. There are many reasons why this could be you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maybe you missed key lessons due to illness.</li>
    <li>Maybe you had a bad teacher.</li>
    <li>Maybe you lost interest at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the good news? It can all be fixed.</p>
<p>With the right guidance and small daily effort, you can strengthen any weak areas.</p>

<h2>Quick Test: Where Does Your Knowledge Break Down?</h2>
<p>Try these questions and see how you do:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Work out \( 349.76 + 28.2 \) (Adding with decimals)</li>
    <li>Work out \( 623.98 - 187.914 \) (Subtracting with decimals)</li>
    <li>Work out \( 0.14 \times 86 \) (Multiplying with decimals)</li>
    <li>Work out \( 42.72 \div 0.12 \) (Dividing with decimals)</li>
    <li>Find what \( \frac{4}{9} \) of 252 is (Fractions of an amount)</li>
    <li>Work out \( -12 - (23 - 4) \times 2 \) (Negative numbers & BIDMAS)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you struggled with any of these, now you know what to focus on.</p>
<p>Go and find more practice questions on that topic!</p>

<h2>Answers below:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>\( 377.96 \)</li>
    <li>\( 436.066 \)</li>

    <li>\( 112 \)</li>
    <li>\( -50 \)</li>
</ul>

<p>Stronger foundations make everything easier. Don't ignore the basics!</p>
