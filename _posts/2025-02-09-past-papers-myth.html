<p>Many students (and even tutors) believe that doing past papers over and over again is the best way to revise.</p>
    
<p> But if that's all you do, you'll hit a wall.</p>

<p>Every past paper covers a mix of topics. If you get a trigonometry question wrong, fixing that one mistake isn't enough.</p>
<p>You need to go back and master the whole topic.</p>

<p>Exams highlight weaknesses. They don't fix them.</p>

<h2>Why This Doesn't Work</h2>
<p>Imagine a footballer trying to improve by only playing matches. </p>
<p>If their shooting is weak, they won't improve just by playing games. They need to take hundreds of shots in training.</p>

<p>The same goes for stamina. A player won't build endurance just by playing full matches.</p>
<p>They need specific fitness drills to improve their running ability.</p>

<p>Students need to take the same approach.</p>

<h2>How to Actually Improve</h2>
<p>Instead of repeating past papers, focus on one topic at a time.</p>
<p>Work through the hardest questions so you're fully confident before moving on.</p>

<p>If you want a Grade 9, you need to master every topic.</p>
    
<p>That means tackling the toughest versions of each question type. Examiners will test every small detail - so you need to be ready.</p>

<p>Past papers help you check progress. But real improvement comes from focused practice.</p>

<p>Train like an athlete. Fix your weaknesses. Then, when the exam comes, you'll be unstoppable.</p>
