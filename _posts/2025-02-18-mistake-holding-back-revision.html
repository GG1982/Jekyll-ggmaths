<p>Ever revised a topic, thought you nailed it, then bombed a question on it later?</p>
<p>It's not because you don't understand the topic - it's because you're revising the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Most students waste time revising the wrong topics.</p>
<p>They assume that if they get a sequences question wrong, sequences must be their weak area.</p>
<p>But often, the real issue is algebra, fractions, or some other hidden weakness inside the question.</p>
<p>This is why many students feel stuck. They revise for hours but don't improve.</p>
<p>When you get a question wrong, ask yourself this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What step did I get stuck on?</li>
    <li>Was it the topic itself, or the maths behind it?</li>
    <li>Could I do this if it was worded differently?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Let's take an example:</h2>

<h3>Question 1: Arithmetic Sequences (Easy)</h3>
<p>Here are the first four terms of a sequence:</p>
<p>6, 10, 14, 18</p>
<p>(a) Write an expression, in terms of \( n \), for the \( n \)th term.</p>

<p>The sequence increases by 4 each time, so the formula is:</p>
<p>\[ \text{nth term} = 4n + 2 \]</p>

<h3>Question 2: Fibonacci-style Sequence (Harder)</h3>
<p>Now let's try this:</p>
<p>The first three terms of a sequence are:</p>
<p>\( a, b, a + b \)</p>
<p>(a) Show that the 6th term of this sequence is \( 3a + 5b \).</p>

<p>Given that the 3rd term is 7 and the 6th term is 29,</p>
<p>(b) Find the value of \( a \) and \( b \).</p>

<h2>Why Do Students Struggle?</h2>
<p>The first question feels familiar. It has numbers.</p>
<p>The second question uses letters. Even though it's still sequences, students panic because it looks different.</p>
<p>The problem isn't sequences - it's algebra.</p>

<h2>How to Actually Fix It</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Find the Real Weakness</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Review the question properly</strong> - Don't just say “I got this topic wrong.” Look at why you got it wrong.</li>
    <li><strong>Write down the skill you actually struggled with</strong> - If the problem was algebra, not sequences, focus your revision on algebra.</li>
    <li><strong>Go back to the fundamentals</strong> - If you struggle with algebra in sequences, go back and practice solving equations separately before trying sequences again.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 2: Break It Down</h3>
<p>For the Fibonacci-style question, let's write out the terms:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned} 
1^{st} &= a \\  
2^{nd} &= b \\  
3^{rd} &= a + b \\  
4^{th} &= (a + b) + b = a + 2b \\  
5^{th} &= (a + 2b) + (a + b) = 2a + 3b \\  
6^{th} &= (2a + 3b) + (a + 2b) = 3a + 5b  
\end{aligned}  
\]</p>

<p>Now, we're told:</p>
<p>\[
a + b = 7, \quad 3a + 5b = 29
\]</p>

<p>This gives us a simultaneous equations problem, not a sequences problem.</p>

<p>Solving:</p>
<ol>
    <li>\( a + b = 7 \)</li>
    <li>\( 3a + 5b = 29 \)</li>
</ol>

<p>Multiply equation 1 by 3:</p>
<p>\[
3a + 3b = 21
\]</p>
<p>Now subtract:</p>
<p>\[
(3a + 5b) - (3a + 3b) = 29 - 21  
\]</p>
<p>\[
2b = 8 \Rightarrow b = 4  
\]</p>

<p>Substituting into \( a + b = 7 \):</p>
<p>\[
a + 4 = 7 \Rightarrow a = 3  
\]</p>

<p>Final answer:</p>
<p>\[
a = 3, \quad b = 4
\]</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Most students never do this. </p>
<p>They revise what they think is the problem, not what the problem actually is.</p>
<p>That's why they spend months revising but never feel more confident.</p>
<p>If you take just one thing from this: Before you revise, figure out exactly what you need to fix. It's the fastest way to improve.</p>
<p>Fix the hidden weakness first, and you'll improve much faster.</p>
