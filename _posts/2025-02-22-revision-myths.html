<p>Most students think revising for maths means long, exhausting study sessions. But that's not true.</p>
<p>You don't need hours of work to improve. You just need 10 minutes a day - if you focus on the right things.</p>

<h2>The Power of 10 Minutes</h2>
<p>I once had a student who was working at a grade 5 level. She didn't cram. She didn't do hours of revision.</p>
<p>Instead, she did one simple thing: Every day, she answered 3 maths questions or worked for 10 minutes - whichever came first.</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, she improved massively. When GCSE results came out, she had jumped from a grade 5 to a grade 8.</p>
<p>No grinding. No burnout. Just consistent, focused effort.</p>

<h2>Why This Works</h2>
<p>Most students think big results require big effort. But the truth is, they underestimate what small, daily practice can achieve over time.</p>
<p>If a student does just 3 questions a day, that's:</p>
<ul>
    <li>21 questions a week (about the same as one exam paper)</li>
    <li>840 questions over 40 weeks (around 40 exam papers)</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't matter how bad you think you are at maths - if you answer 840 questions, your maths will improve. That's a guarantee.</p>

<h2>Why Most Students Get This Wrong</h2>
<p>Some students sit down for hours of revision but don't actually learn much.</p>
<p>They spend time rewriting notes, reading through examples, or watching videos - but they don't actually answer enough questions.</p>
<p>The secret isn't just time spent. It's doing the right work. And the best way to improve in maths is to answer questions.</p>

<h2>How to Apply This</h2>
<p>It's simple:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set a daily goal: 3 questions or 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pick questions that challenge you but aren't impossible.</li>
    <li>Write out full solutions, not just answers.</li>
    <li>Keep it up for a year.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end, you won't just be better at maths. You'll have built a habit of daily problem-solving that makes everything feel easier.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Most students overestimate what they can do in a day but underestimate what they can achieve in a year.</p>
<p>If you're struggling with maths, don't try to “grind” your way to success. Just be consistent. Do a little bit every day.</p>
<p>It's not about working longer. It's about working smarter.</p>
