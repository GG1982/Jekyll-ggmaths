<p>Speed matters in exams, but rushing leads to mistakes. You need to be fast and accurate.</p>
<p>Here's how:</p>

<h3>1. Learn Methods, Not Just Answers</h3>
<p>Don't just memorise answers. Understand why a method works.</p>
<p>If there's a quicker way to solve something, use it.</p>

<h3>2. Know Your Times Tables</h3>
<p>Quick recall makes everything easier. Practise daily until you don't have to think.</p>

<h3>3. Use Mental Maths</h3>
<p>Some steps don't need written working.</p>
<p>Spot shortcuts.</p>
<p>For example, instead of calculating \( 50 \times 24 \) directly, think of it as:</p>
<p>\[
50 \times 24 = 50 \times 25 - 50
\]
</p>

<h3>4. Avoid Common Mistakes</h3>
<p>Sign errors (\(+\), \(-\)) cost marks.</p>
<p>Circle or underline them. Work neatly so you can spot errors fast.</p>

<h3>5. Keep Your Work Organised</h3>
<p>Messy writing leads to silly mistakes.</p>
<p>Space out your work. If you make an error, cross it out neatly.</p>

<h3>6. Practise Under Exam Conditions</h3>
<p>Set a time limit. Train yourself to finish with 5 minutes spare.</p>

<h3>7. Check Your Work</h3>
<p>Always check using a different method.</p>
<p>If you have time, redo tricky questions from scratch.</p>

<h3>8. Speed Drills with Easy Questions</h3>
<p>Set <strong>20-25 easy questions (1-5 marks)</strong> and answer as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Mark your work at the end. Aim for <strong>90% or more</strong>.</p>
<p>If you drop below that, slow down and fix mistakes before trying again.</p>

<p><strong>Speed comes from practice.</strong></p>
<p>Work fast, but never rush.</p>
