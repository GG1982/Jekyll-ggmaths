<p>Some students freeze when they see a tricky algebra question. They don't know where to begin.</p>

<p>A simple trick is to <strong>start from the basics</strong> and list everything you know.</p>

<h2>Example Question:</h2>
<p><em>Prove that a shape with angles</em> \(12x + 34\), \(7x - 6\), \(15x\), <em>and</em> \(8x - 4\) <em>is a trapezium.</em></p>
<p><strong>5 marks</strong></p>

<h2>Step 1: What Do We Know About Trapeziums?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A trapezium has <strong>four angles</strong>.</li>
    <li>The sum of all four angles must be <strong>360Â°</strong>.</li>
    <li>Exactly two of the sides are parallel.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, we can add them all up, as we know they must equal to 360:</p>
<p>\[(12x + 34) + (7x - 6) + (15x) + (8x - 4) = 360\]</p>

<h2>Step 2: Solve for \(x\)</h2>
<p>First, collect like terms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All the \(x\) terms: \[12x + 7x + 15x + 8x = 42x\]</li>
    <li>All the numbers: \[34 - 6 - 4 = 24\]</li>
</ul>

<p>So we get:</p>
<p>\[42x + 24 = 360\]</p>

<p>Now, subtract 24 from both sides:</p>
<p>\[42x = 336\]</p>

<p>Divide by 42:</p>
<p>\[x = 8\]</p>

<h2>Step 3: Find the Angles</h2>
<p>Now, we might as well know what each angle is.</p>
<p>So let's substitute \(x = 8\) back into each angle:</p>
<p>\[12(8) + 34 = 96 + 34 = 130\]</p>
<p>\[7(8) - 6 = 56 - 6 = 50\]</p>
<p>\[15(8) = 120\]</p>
<p>\[8(8) - 4 = 64 - 4 = 60\]</p>

<p>The four angles are: <strong>130Â°, 50Â°, 120Â°, and 60Â°.</strong></p>

<h2>Step 4: Check for Parallel Sides</h2>
<p>Now, at this point we have probably achieved 3 of the 5 marks.</p>
<p>To get the last two, what do we know about angles in parallel sides?</p>
<p>Maybe you can remember co-interior angles add to 180.</p>
<p>If opposite angles add to <strong>180Â°</strong>, then the sides between them are parallel.</p>

<p>\[130Â° + 50Â° = 180Â°\]</p>
<p>\[120Â° + 60Â° = 180Â°\]</p>

<p>Since we have two pairs of co-interior angles (C-shape) adding to 180Â°, the shape must have <strong>one pair of parallel sides</strong>.</p>

<p>This proves the shape is a <strong>trapezium</strong>. âœ…</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're stuck, don't panic. Start with the basics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>âœ… Write down what you know about the shape.</li>
    <li>âœ… Look for key properties (like angles adding to 360Â°).</li>
    <li>âœ… Solve step by step and check your answers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Breaking problems down like this makes hard questions much easier. Try it next time! ðŸ’¡</p>
