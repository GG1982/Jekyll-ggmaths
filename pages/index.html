        <h2 class="font-3">Hey There,</h2>
        <p>Looks like you're on the hunt for a maths tutor.</p>
        <p>Maybe your child is struggling with confidence.</p>
        <p>Maybe they're stuck at a grade that just isn't good enough.</p>
        <p>Or maybe they just need a bit of extra support to reach their full potential.</p>
        <p>But let's be honest - this is about more than just passing an exam.</p>
        <p>A top grade in maths isn't just a number. It's a statement.</p>
        <p>But instead of giving you a long sales pitch, let me tell you a quick story.</p>    

        <h3 class="mt-2 font-2">Ben's Story - From Grade 3 to Grade 7</h3>
        <p>Last year, a student named Ben came to me at the start of Year 11.</p>
        <p>He was sitting on a Grade 3 in maths - failing.</p>
        <p>Confidence shattered. His parents were worried.</p>
        <p>Fast forward a year, after working together consistently, Ben walked out of his exam with a Grade 7.</p>
        <p> That's a huge jump.</p>
        <a class="body-link capitalize font-0" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SS6i73BtQZgk6Aj5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's what Ben had to say:</a>
        <blockquote>"Highly recommend, managed to go up 4 grades from a grade 3 to a grade 7 in less than a year! Really improved my understanding of maths  and was so helpful üòÅ ‚Ä¶"</blockquote>

        <p>And Ben isn't the only one.</p>
        <p>I've worked with hundreds of students, and the results speak for themselves:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li class="font-0"><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> {{ profile_reviews.user_ratings_total }} five-star reviews on <a class="body-link capitalize" href="{{ site.reviews }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">google</a></li>
            <li class="font-0"><i class="bi bi-youtube"></i> A <a class="body-link capitalize" href="https://www.youtube.com/@GGMaths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> with 4,000+ subscribers and over 250,000 views</li>
            <li class="font-0"><i class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow"></i> A <a class="body-link capitalize" href="{{ site.url }}/#reviews">proven track record</a> of helping students go from struggling to thriving</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But let's not beat around the bush. </p>
        <p>You're here because you need results.</p>
        <p>That's exactly what I do.</p>
        <p>And if I can't personally help, I have a small team of expert tutors who can.</p>
        <p>I only take on a limited number of students to ensure they get the support they need.</p>
        <p>So, let's talk about your child.</p>
        <p>Click below to schedule a quick chat - either online or over the phone.</p>
        <p>Spots are limited, so don't wait too long.</p>

        <h2 class="font-3 capitalize">No more 'hope and guesswork'</h2>
        <p>Most students (and tutors) try to improve by guessing their way through.</p>
        <p>They revise the wrong topics, cram for hours, and think more past papers will magically make them better.</p>
        <p>We call this the <strong>brute-force method.</strong></p>
        <p>It's exhausting, ineffective, and leads to frustration, burnout, and wasted time.</p>
        <p>I've spent over a decade refining a system that actually works. </p>
        <p>Not through luck. Not through talent. But through precision.</p>
        <p>I identify the real weaknesses, fix broken foundations, and turn maths from a struggle into a science.</p>
        <p>No fluff. <strong>No wasted effort.</strong></p>
        <p>Just proven methods that take you from confused and stuck to confident and unstoppable.</p>

                <div class="coach-body">
                    <p>It's a common belief that you should only hire a tutor if you're struggling with a subject.</p>
                        
                    <p>And you should <em>not</em> hire a tutor if you're achieving high results in class! However, this mindset can limit your potential.</p>

                    <p>Consider top athletes like Rafael Nadal or Lionel Messi‚Äîthey wouldn't reach their peak without their coaches. Similarly, students aiming for excellence need the right support to achieve their highest potential.</p>

                    <p>If you're an ambitious student aiming for a top university or a high-flying career, you need to be among the best. Achieving top grades like a 9 or an A* is crucial, but to truly stand out, you need to go beyond these scores.</p>

                    <p>For students pursuing stem paths, I aim to keep them a year ahead in their studies. This allows us to focus on applying to the best universities or securing top apprenticeships.</p>

                    <p>Many of my top students now study at prestigious institutions like Bath, LSE, and Imperial, or work in competitive industries.</p>
                    
                    <p>My approach is to help students complete GCSE math by Year 10, allowing us to start A-level math in Year 11. This strategy gives them extra time to focus on other subjects and strengthens their A-level preparation.</p>

                    <p>It's a challenging path, but the rewards are worth it.</p>

                    <p>Giuliano was a friendly, engaging and thorough tutor. He ensured I was fully-equipped with the skills required to sit Maths A-Level. I obtained a <span class="fancy-text capitalize">grade A</span>, ultimately getting me into my firm university. I couldn't have asked for anyone better. I highly recommend him to any maths students! Thank you Giuliano üôè</p>

                    <p>Giuliano really helped my daughter with a few things she was struggling with, and helped her to achieve a <span class="fancy-text capitalize">Grade 9</span> at GCSE. Very highly recommended!</p>

                    <p>Giuliano is an excellent Maths tutor, with a really friendly, approachable manner. He was just what our son needed when he was struggling to prepare for his GCSE. He has just achieved a <span class="fancy-text capitalize">grade 7</span> which is far higher than he could have hoped for without Giuliano's help. We would have no hesitation in highly recommending Giuliano.</p>

                    <p>Great teaching and easy to understand. Before my tutor, I was working at a grade 6 level. But with the help and support, they managed to get me working to <span class="fancy-text capitalize">a grade 8</span>. Thanks for the help!</p>

                    <p>Before Giuliano came to teach me I was getting 3's and maybe a 4 on a good day. Fast forward to my actual GCSE I end up <span class="fancy-text capitalize">getting a 7</span>. Definitely wouldn't doable without Giuliano coming over every weekend to help me with my maths.</p>
