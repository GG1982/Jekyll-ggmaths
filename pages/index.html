                    <p>My love for it began while studying maths at The University of East Anglia. While there, I worked with a charity to help children from underprivileged backgrounds improve their maths and English.</p>

                    <p>Watching the growth of these children was incredible and inspired me to pursue this as my job.</p>

                    <p>I knew if I wanted to make the most impact on a student, it would be in a one-to-one setting. That's because I can change my style to fit the student's needs.</p>

                    <p>To make the most impact on a student, it would be in a 1-to-1 lesson. I can change my style to fit the student's needs.</p>

                    <p>And for the last 7 years, I have done that. I've helped students go from grade 3 to grade 7 in their GCSEs.</p>
                    
                    <!-- <p>I have worked alongside local primary schools, such as Ashmole Primary and Osidge School, teaching small groups of children.</p> -->

                    <p>I have helped A-Level students with their entrance exams to Oxford or Cambridge.</p>

                    <p>I'm extraordinarily proud of each of my students and go to the best of my ability to give them the support they're seeking.</p>

                    <p>The Olympiad is a maths event for children in primary and secondary school. Winning can help you get into the best universities like Cambridge and Oxford.</p>
                        
                    <p>You can also be head-hunted at companies like Jane Street, Two Sigma Investments, or Quora.</p>

                    <p>Olympiad problems go much further than regular school questions. They make you understand topics more deeply.</p>
                    
                    <p>I use these problems to help my GCSE students go from grade 7/8 to grade 9.</p>

I obtained a <span class="fancy-text capitalize">grade A</span>, ultimately getting me into my firm university. I couldn't have asked for anyone better. I highly recommend him to any maths students!

                    <p>Giuliano is an excellent Maths tutor, with a really friendly, approachable manner. He was just what our son needed when he was struggling to prepare for his GCSE. He has just achieved a <span class="fancy-text capitalize">grade 7</span> which is far higher than he could have hoped for without Giuliano's help. We would have no hesitation in highly recommending Giuliano.</p>
